# TMUX create new workspaces

## Getting start

place `new-tws` in your `.local/bin` or other dir in your path.

if `new-tws` command not found add this path to your .bashrc
`export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin` or simply replace it to the directory `new-tws`

new-tws will create workspaces at `~/.local/tmux-workspaces` directory.

add this to your .bashrc to be able to run workspace
`export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/tmux-workspaces`
